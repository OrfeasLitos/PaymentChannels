* p. 2
  * Scalability: all/all -> up to 100 tx/s
  * No validate company depts txs, only no cheat
* p. 3
  * able to move off-chain to on-chain alone, loss-free
  * optimistic progress
* p. 4
  * general Pay Chans, not only LN
  * 2 members/channel
  * Members create and bcast F
  * "channel" not one tx: many keys and txs
  * dashed - channel, solid - tx
* p. 5
  * new version, diff balance
  * new txs that invalidate old
* p. 6
  * Can update repeatedly
  * Nothing on-chain
* p. 8
  * Bob could also do
  * technicalities and asterisks
* p. 10
  * Charlie gets coins in ch w Alice, gives in ch w Bob. Total balance not changed
  * that's why a.k.a. payment networks
  * that's why this is interesting
  * Charlie can't keep it
  * LN -- virtual channels different
* p. 11
  * Very LN - specific
  * Hashed Time Locked Contract
* p. 12
  * hash hardcoded in contract
  * let this sink in
* p. 13
  * pre-signatures phase
* p. 14
  * contract signing phase
* p. 15
  * contract fulfilling phase
* p. 16
  * surprisingly, no rigorous analysis yet
  * real world protocol -> hard
