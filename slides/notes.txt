* p. 2
  * Scalability: up to hundreds of txs/s (we need 10s of 1000s of txs/s to
    compete with VISA)
  * But I don't care to validate txs between e.g. internal departments of a
    company, as long as the company doesn't cheat
* p. 3
  * in other words, any party that has money off-chain should be able to move
    it on-chain again unilaterally. An honest party should never lose money
    when doing this (apart from on-chain tx fees)
  * optimistic progress
* p. 4
  * payment channels in general, not specifically LN
  * only 2 members per channel
  * Alice and Bob cooperate to create a tx and put it on-chain (1 on-chain tx)
  * either party can spend F and take their part (they each hold special txs)
* p. 5
  * They can then create a new version where Alice has 1.1 and Bob 1.9
  * They create new special txs to hold and invalidate old ones
  * F is a real tx on-chain
  * But the "channel" in the image isn't one tx, but rather some keys and txs
    held by Alice and Bob, different in each specific construction.
* p. 6
  * They can do many updates
  * No touching the blockchain
* p. 8
  * could be done by Bob
  * many, many, many technicalities and asterisks
* p. 9
  * if Alice <-> Charlie and Charlie <-> Bob, then Alice <--> Bob
* p. 10
  * that's why a.k.a. payment networks
  * that's why this is interesting
  * Charlie can't keep it
  * LN - like -- virtual channels somewhat different
* p. 11
  * Very LN - specific
  * Hashed Time Locked Contract
