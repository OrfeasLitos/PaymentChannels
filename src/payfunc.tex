  All players need to register in order to use channels. The registration of
  \alice{} works as follows: \alice{} inputs her desired delay and relayDelay
  that will be used for all her future channels. The first denotes how often she
  has to check the blockchain for revoked commitments and the second defines the
  minimum time distance between incoming and outgoing CLTV expiries. \fpaynet{}
  then informs \simulator{}, who sends back a long-lived public key for \alice.
  This key represents \alice's account, from where \fpaynet{} can get coins to
  open new channels on her behalf and to place coins of closed channels. The key
  is sent to \alice{} who moves some initial funds to it and notifies
  \fpaynet{}. She is now registered. The exact logic is found in
  Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:support}, which also contains the actions of \fpaynet{}
  related to corruptions.

  Additionally, the procedure \texttt{checkClosed}() is called after
  \textsc{read}ing from \ledger, with the received state $\Sigma$as input. This
  call happens every time \fpaynet{} \textsc{read}s from \ledger. The formal
  definition of \texttt{checkClosed}() can be found in
  Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func}, along with a discussion of its purpose.

  The process of \alice{} opening a channel with \bob{} is as follows: First
  \alice{} asks \fpaynet{} to open and \fpaynet{} informs \simulator.
  \simulator{} provides the necessary keys and IDs for the new channel to
  \fpaynet. \alice{} asks \fpaynet{} to check if \ledger{} contains the funding
  transaction from \alice's point of view. If it does, \fpaynet{} activates
  \simulator, who in turn returns control to \fpaynet{}. Now \fpaynet{} checks
  that the funding transaction is in the \ledger{} also from \bob's point of
  view and in case it does, it notifies \simulator. \simulator{} then confirms
  that to \fpaynet{} that the channel is open and \fpaynet{} finally stores the
  channel as open. This last exchange is needed to match the real-world
  interaction.

  When instructed to perform a payment, \fpaynet{} simply takes note of the
  message and forwards it to \simulator. It also remembers to inform the payer
  that the payment has been completed when \simulator{} says so. Observe here
  that \fpaynet{} trusts \simulator{} to correctly carry out channel updates.
  While counterintuitive, it allows \fpaynet{} to ignore the details of channel
  updates, signatures, key and transaction handling. Nevertheless, as we will
  see \fpaynet{} keeps track of requested and ostensibly carried out updates and
  ensures that upon channel closure the balances are as expected, therefore
  ensuring funds security.

  The message \textsc{resolvePays}, sent by \simulator{}, is supposed to contain
  a list of resolved payments, along with who was charged for each payment after
  all. For each entry there are four ``happy paths'' that do not lead to
  \fpaynet{} halting (\fpaynet{} halts when it cannot uphold its security
  guarantees anymore): if the payment failed and no balance is changed, if the
  charged player is the one who initiated the payment, if the charged player is
  corrupted or if she has not checked the blockchain at the right times, i.e.
  was negligent (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ov-paynet} and formally
  defined in Figures~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay}
  and~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:haltcond:abs}). In case the payment was
  completed in a legal manner, the balance of all channels involved is updated
  accordingly (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:loops}). Conversely, \fpaynet{}
  halts if the charged player was not on the payment path
  (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay},
  l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:halt:path}), if a signature forgery has taken
  place (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay},
  l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:halt:ds}), if the charged player has not been
  negligent (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay},
  ll.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:halt:rel}
  and~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:halt:abs}), or if any one of the individual
  channel updates needed to carry out the whole payment has not been previously
  reported with an \textsc{update} message by \simulator{}
  (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:loops},
  l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:loops:halt:do}).

  Similarly to payment instructions, when \fpaynet{} receives a message
  instructing it to close a channel (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close}), it takes a
  note of the pending closure, it stops serving any more requests for this
  channel and it forwards the request to \simulator. In turn \simulator{}
  notifies \fpaynet{} of a closed channel with the corresponding message, upon
  which \fpaynet{} takes a note to inform the corresponding player. Depending on
  whether the message instructed for a unilateral or a cooperative close,
  \fpaynet{} will either put or not a time limit respectively to the service of
  the request. In particular, in case of cooperative close, the time limit is
  infinity (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:coop:mark}). As we will see, in case a
  unilateral close request was made and the time limit for servicing it is
  reached, \fpaynet{} halts (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func},
  l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:idle}). Once more \fpaynet{} trusts \simulator,
  but later checks that the chain contains the correct transactions with
  \texttt{checkClosed}() (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func}).

  After every \textsc{read} \fpaynet{} sends to \ledger{} and its response is

  channels and, in case no security violation has taken place, it updates the
  on- and off-chain balances of the player accordingly
  (ll.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:happy:start}-\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:happy:end}).
  The possible security violations are: signature forgery
  (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:dsforgery}), malicious closure even though the
  player was not negligent (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:malicious}), no
  closing transaction in $\Sigma$ even though the player asked for channel
  closure a substantial amount of time before
  (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:idle}) and incorrect on- or off-chain balance
  after the closing of all of the player's channels

  \textsc{poll} is a request that every player has to make to \fpaynet{}
  periodically (once every \texttt{delay} blocks, as set on registration) in
  order to remain non-negligent. In a software implementation, such a request
  would be automatically sent at safe time intervals. When receiving
  \textsc{poll} (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll}), \fpaynet{} checks the ledger for
  maliciously closed channels and halts in case of a forgery
  (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll:dsforgery}) or in case of a successful malicious
  closing of a channel whilst the offended player was non-negligent
  (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll:haspolled:halt}). If on the other hand a channel has
  been closed maliciously but the offended player did not \textsc{poll} in time,
  she is marked as negligent (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll:negligent}).

  The last part of \fpaynet{} (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:daemon}) contains some
  additional ``daemon'' messages that help various processes carry on.
  \textsc{pushFulfill}, \textsc{pushAdd} and \textsc{commit} are simply
  forwarded to \simulator. They exist because the ``token of execution'' in the
  protocol does not follow the strict order required by UC, and thus some
  additional messages are needed for the protocol to carry on. In other words,
  they are needed due to the incompatibility of the serial execution of UC and
  the asynchronous nature of LN.

  \textsc{FulfillOnChain} has to be sent by a multi-hop payment intermediary
  that has not been paid by the previous player off-chain in order to close the
  channel. The request is noted and forwarded to \simulator. \textsc{getNews}
  requests from \fpaynet{} information on newly opened, closed and updated
  channels.
