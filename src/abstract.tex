\begin{abstract}
  Blockchains have enabled the decentralized exchange of digital currencies with
  minimal trust assumptions~\cite{bitcoin,gkl}. Nevertheless, the massive
  replication of data amongst participating nodes has a detrimental effect on
  scalability~\cite{scaling}. One approach to addressing the issue is layer-2
  payment networks, which enable users to perform the vast majority of their
  transactions without adding them to the
  blockchain~\cite{lightning,decker,teechan,perun}. The most widely adopted
  layer-2 solution, which is deployed on top of Bitcoin, is the Lightning
  Payment Network (LN)~\cite{lightning}. In this work we prove that LN is secure
  in the Universal Composability framework~\cite{uc}. We formally describe the
  LN
  protocol\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/}},
  abstract its intended purpose in a functionality and prove that the specified
  protocol UC-realizes it.
