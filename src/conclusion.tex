\section{Conclusion}
  The present work constitutes a fortunate result, since it conclusively proves
  that software that adhere to the lightning specification cannot lose funds
  accidentally to a malicious protocol player. Indeed, such a result reinforces
  trust to the lightning network and acts as a guarantee to the almost 900
  bitcoins currently in circulation in the layer-2 protocol.

  By leveraging the guarantees provided by the Universal Composition framework,
  we further assert that the lightning protocol is freely composable with other
  protocols. As such it can run side by side with arbitrary concurrent
  protocols, or be used as a subroutine to higher-level protocols without
  needing to prove its security anew.

  By separating particular subroutines of the protocol as distinct cryptographic
  primitives and analysing them individually, we have contributed to its
  cryptorgaphic agility. Lastly, by keeping it as protocol-agnostic as possible,
  our payment network functionality can be adapted to express the functional and
  security requirements of other layer-2 protocols with relative ease.
