\section{Overview of our Combined Signature primitive}
  As previously mentioned, we define in this work a new primitive for combining
  keys and generating signatures that is leveraged in the revocation and
  punishment mechanism of channel updates. Furthermore, we prove that the
  construction designed by the creators of LN realizes this primitive. We here
  provide the intuition behind it and refer the reader to
  Appendix~\ref{appendix:combinedsign} for the exact syntax, correctness and
  security definitions, concrete construction and proof of security.

  A combined signature is a two-party primitive, say \alice{} and \bob{} with
  \bob{} playing the role of the signer and \alice{} the holder of a share of
  the secret-key that is essential for issuing signatures verifiable with the
  ``combined'' verification key. The  derivation of the verification key is
  achieved  using public information drawn from  \alice{} and \bob and is
  feasible without any party knowing the corresponding signing key. Only if
  \alice{} shares her secret information with \bob{} will he be able to
  construct the signing key.
  Beyond correctness, combined signatures have two security properties expressed
  as follows. Share-EUF security expresses security from the point of view of
  \alice{}, and establishes that \bob{} is incapable of issuing a valid combined
  signature if he does not possess the corresponding secret share. On the other
  hand, master-EUF-CMA security is modeled very similarly to standard EUF-CMA
  security, with the difference that \bob{} (the signer) combines malicious
  shares into his public-key and issues signatures with respect to such combined
  keys that still provide no advantage to the adversary in terms of producing a
  forged message for a combined key of its choice.
