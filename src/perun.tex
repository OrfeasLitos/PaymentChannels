\section{Perun}
  Perun~\cite{perun} is a payment network designed for Turing-complete smart contract
  scripting languages. It has been implemented for Ethereum. Its main contribution is
  \textit{multistate channels} that allow the dynamic deployment of virtual contracts,
  known as \textit{nanocontracts}. Contracts of this type do not have to enter the
  blockchain if all parties are cooperative and only do so in case of a dispute.

  The paper describes specifically the use of such multistate channels for creating
  virtual payment channels between parties that do not have a basic payment channel
  between them, but both have basic multistate channels with an intermediary. Then the
  intermediary could substitute for the blockchain and thus a virtual payment channel on
  top of the two basic multistate channels can be created. The parties need the
  intermediary only for setting up the channel and to close it fast. If the intermediary
  refuses to close the channel, they can always fall back to the blockchain in order to
  close it.
