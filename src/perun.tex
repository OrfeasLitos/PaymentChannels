\section{Perun}
  The basic feature of Perun is the ability to create payment channels just like
  Lightning. Furthermore, it uses the Turing-completeness of Ethereum contracts to provide
  the option of so-called multistate channels; these channels can effectively support the
  creation of further virtual channels on top of them. Both kinds of channels require two
  moments of interaction with the Ethereum (or any other Turing-complete) blockchain: one
  at the creation and one when closing; the intermediate states of the channel need not be
  recorded on the blockchain.

  As an example, of a virtual payment channel on top of multistate channels, let $Alice$
  and $Ingrid$ have a multistate channel between them and let the same hold for $Ingrid$
  and $Bob$. Both multistate channels correspond to on-chain contracts. Then $Alice$ and
  $Bob$ can create a virtual payment channel with which $Ingrid$ has to interact only at
  its creation; even in case that $Ingrid$ later stops cooperating and does not help the
  other two parties to close the channel, they can both claim their money from their
  underlying multistate channel and eventually from the blockchain, thus $Ingrid$ is
  required only for the virtual channel initiation.

  One practical problem of this construction is that it does not scale well to virtual
  channels with many intermediaries. For $Alice$ to create an $Alice \leftrightarrow Bob$
  virtual payment channel, when the existing multistate channels are $Alice
  \Leftrightarrow Ingrid \Leftrightarrow Jane \Leftrightarrow Bob$, a virtual multistate
  channel specially crafted to support the desired virtual payment channel must be created
  between $Ingrid$ and $Jane$. This means that when $Alice$ requests from $Ingrid$ to
  initiate the $Alice \leftrightarrow Bob$ channel through her and $Jane$, $Ingrid$ has to
  establish a new channel with $Jane$ before forwarding $Alice$'s request to $Jane$. Only
  then is the message from $Jane$ to $Bob$ ready. For $Alice$ to be sure that the virtual
  payment channel is open, she has to wait for another message trip from $Bob$ to $Jane$,
  then to $Ingrid$ and eventually back to her. It seems that the amount of messages needed
  to create a virtual payment channel of length $n$ is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$. This
  is far from the ideal requirement of $Alice$ being able to add a virtual channel with no
  interaction with any other party than $Bob$.
