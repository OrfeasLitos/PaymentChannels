\section{Introduction}
  Payment channels are constructions that permit the secure exchange of assets between
  remote agents without the need for each transaction to be recorded in a global database.
  They are constructed in a way that either does not allow the agents to cheat (given
  appropriate assumptions), or give the opportunity to the cheated agents to report the
  latest valid state to a global database (i.e. blockchain) and reclaim their assets.
