\section{\fpaynet{} high level description}
  One of our contributions is the specification of \fpaynet, a functionality
  that describes the functional and security guarantees given by an ideal
  payment network. The central aim of \fpaynet{} is opening payment channels on
  the ledger, keeping track of their state, updating them according to requested
  payments and closing them, as requested by honest players, all in a secure
  manner. In particular, the three main messages it can receive from \alice{}
  are (\textsc{openChannel}), (\textsc{pay}) and (\textsc{closeChannel}).

  When \fpaynet{} receives (\textsc{openChannel}, \alice, \bob, $x$,
  \textit{tid}) from \alice, it asks \simulator{} to attempt to create a channel
  between \alice{} and \bob{} where \alice{} owns $x$ coins. When it receives
  (\textsc{pay}, \bob, $x, \overrightarrow{\mathtt{path}}$, \texttt{receipt})
  from \alice, it asks \simulator{} to attempt to perform a multi-hop payment of
  $x$ coins from \alice{} to \bob{} along the $\overrightarrow{\mathtt{path}}$.
  As expected, when \fpaynet{} receives (\textsc{closeChannel}, \texttt{receipt},
  \textit{tid}) from \alice, it asks \simulator{} to close the relevant channel.

  In order to provide security guarantees, there are various moments when
  \fpaynet{} verifies whether certain expected events have actually taken place.
  A number of messages prompt \fpaynet{} to read from \ledger{} and perform
  these checks. In the actual implementations of LPN these checks are done
  periodically by a polling daemon. Such checks are done by \fpaynet{} in the
  following cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item On receiving (\textsc{poll}) by \alice, \fpaynet{} asks \ledger{} for
    \alice's latest $\Sigma_{\alice}$ and verifies that no bad events have
    happened. In particular, \fpaynet{} halts if any of \alice's channels has
    been closed maliciously and, even though \alice{} has been \textsc{poll}ing
    regularly, she didn't manage to punish the counterparty. Refer to
    line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll:badevent} of Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:poll} for the
    exact halting condition. If \fpaynet{} doesn't halt, it asks \simulator{} to
    take action against malicious closures and multi-hop payments that have gone
    awry.
    \item \fpaynet{} expects \simulator{} to send a (\textsc{resolvePays},
    \texttt{charged}) message that gives details on the outcome of one or more
    multi-hop payments. \fpaynet{} checks that for each payment the charged
    party was (a) the one that initiated the payment, (b) a malicious party or
    (c) a party that either did not \textsc{poll} in time to catch a malicious
    closure or to learn the preimage from an honest closure, or did not enforce
    the retrieval of her funds by using the preimage to fulfill on chain
    (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay},
    line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:haltcond}). It also halts if a particular
    payment resulted in a channel update for which \simulator{} did not inform
    \fpaynet{} (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:loops},
    line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:resolvepay:loops:halt:do}).
    \item \fpaynet{} executes the function
    \texttt{checkClosed}($\Sigma_{\alice}$) every time it receives
    $\Sigma_{\alice}$ from \ledger{} (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close},
    lines~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:start}-\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:end}).
    It here checks that every channel that \environment{} has asked to be closed
    or \simulator{} designated as closed indeed has a closing transaction that
    corresponds to its latest state in $\Sigma_{\alice}$. Enough time is given
    for that transaction to settle in $\Sigma_{\alice}$, but if that time passes
    and the channel is still open or it is closed to a wrong version and no
    opportunity for punishment was given, \fpaynet{} halts.
  \end{itemize}

  A number of messages that support the protocol execution are handled by
  \fpaynet:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Every player has to send (\textsc{register}, delay, relayDelay) before
    participating in the network. This informs \fpaynet{} how often the player
    has to \textsc{poll}. ``delay'' corresponds to the maximum time between
    \textsc{poll}s so that malicious closures will be caught. ``relayDelay'' is
    useful when the player is an intermediary of a multi-hop payment. It roughly
    represents the size of the time window the player has to learn a preimage
    from the next and reveal it to the previous node. Subsequently \fpaynet{}
    asks \simulator{} to create and send a public key that will hold the
    player's funds. This public key is subsequently sent back to the player.
    \item To complete her registration, \alice has to send the
    (\textsc{toppedUp}) message. It lets \fpaynet{} know that the desired amount
    of initial funds have been transferred to \alice's public key. \fpaynet{}
    reads \alice's state on \ledger{} to retrieve this number and subsequently
    allows \alice{} to participate in the payment network.
    \item When \fpaynet{} receives (\textsc{checkForNew}, \alice, \bob,
    \textit{tid}) from \alice, it asks \ledger{} for \alice's latest state
    $\Sigma_{\alice}$ and looks for a funding transaction $F$ in it. If one is
    found, \simulator{} is asked to complete the opening procedure.
    \item (\textsc{pushFulfill}, \textit{pchid}),
    (\textsc{pushAdd}, \textit{pchid}) and (\textsc{commit}, \textit{pchid})
    all nudge \simulator{} to carry on with the protocol that updates the state
    of a specific channel. \fpaynet{} simply forwards these messages to
    \simulator.
    \item (\textsc{fulfillOnChain}) asks \simulator{} to close channels in which
    the counterparty is not willing to pay, even though they have promised to do
    so upon disclosure of a particular preimage. This message is forwarded to
    \simulator{}, but also \fpaynet{} takes a note that such a message was
    received.
  \end{itemize}

  Last but not least, \environment{} sends (\textsc{getNews}) to obtain the
  latest changes regarding newly opened or closed channels, along with updates
  to the state of existing ones. Here we make an interesting observation: The
  most complex part of LPN is arguably the negotiations that happen when a
  multi-hop payment takes place, due to the many channel updates needed; indeed,
  two complete channel updates for each hop are needed for a successful payment
  to go through. The fact that a proposal for an update can happen
  asynchronously with the commitment to this update, along with the fact that a
  single commitment may commit to many indiviual update proposals only adds to
  the complexity. It is therefore only natural to want \fpaynet{} to be unaware
  of these details. In order to disentangle the abstraction of \fpaynet{} from
  such minutiae, we had to allow for minor cases where the updates reported back
  to \environment{} may be wrong (in the case \simulator{} is adversarial).
  Nevertheless, such mistakes are always caught by \fpaynet{} when a channel
  closes. This is somehow intuitive: Consider a user of the payment network that
  does not understand its inner workings but can read \ledger{} and count her
  funds there. In case the payment network is not trustworthy, the only way she
  can verify that her funds are exactly as the network reports is by closing the
  relevant channel and checking her state in \ledger.
