    The protocol $\Pi_{\mathrm{LN}}$ realises $\fpaynet$ given a global
    functionality $\ledger$ and assuming the security of the underlying digital
    signature, identity-based signature, combined digital signature and PRF.

    where $n$ is the maximum number of registered users, $m$ is the maximum
    number of channels that a user is involved in, $p$ is the maximum number of
    times that a channel is updated and the ``E-'' terms correspond to the
    insecurity bounds of the primitives.
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{proofsketch}
    The proof is done in 5 steps of successive games replacement. In
    Lemma~\ref{lemma:dummy} we define a simulator $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN}}$
    that internally simulates a full execution of $\Pi_{\mathrm{LN}}$ for each
    player, and a ``dummy'' functionality that acts as a simple relay between
    \environment{} and $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN}}$. We argue that this version of
    the ideal world trivially produces the exact same messages for
    \environment{} as the real world.

    In each subsequent step, we incrementally move responsibilities from the
    simulator to the functionality, while ensuring the change is transparent to
    both \environment{} and \adversary. Each step defines a different
    functionality that handles some additional messages from \environment{}
    exactly like \fpaynet, until the last step (Lemma~\ref{lemma:close}) where
    we use \fpaynet{} itself. Correspondingly, the simulator of each step is
    adapted so that the new ideal execution is computationally indistinguishable
    from the previous one. For each step we exhaustively trace the differences
    from the previous step in order to prove that, given the same messages from
    \environment{} and \adversary{}, the resulting responses remain unchanged.

    Lemma~\ref{lemma:reg} lets $\mathcal{F}$ handle registration messages,
    along with the corruption messages from \simulator. In Lemma~\ref{lemma:open}
    the functionality additionally handles messages related to channel opening. It
    behaves like \fpaynet, but does not execute \texttt{checkClosed}().
    Lemma~\ref{lemma:pay} has the functionality handle all messages sent during
    channel updates. Lastly, Lemma~\ref{lemma:close} has the entire \fpaynet{} as
    its functionality, by incorporating the message for closing a channel,
    executing \texttt{checkClosed}() normally and handing the message that returns
    to \environment{} the receipts for newly opened, updated and closed
    channels. The last two steps introduce a probability of failure in case
    the various types of signatures used in  $\Pi_{\mathrm{LN}}$ are forged. We analyze these cases separately and argue that, if
    such forgeries do not happen, the emulation is perfect. Therefore we can
    calculate the concrete security bounds shown in the theorem.
  \end{proofsketch}
  As a concrete example of the proof approach, proving Lemma~\ref{lemma:reg}
  entails the following parts: First $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}}$ is defined
  (Fig.~\ref{alg:proof:fpaynet:reg}), which is a functionality that behaves
  exactly like \fpaynet{} when receiving the messages \textsc{register},
  \textsc{registerDone}, \textsc{toppedUp} and \textsc{corrupted}, but simply
  forwards all other messages along with the sender to \simulator. Then
  $\simulator{}_{\mathrm{LN - Reg}}$ is defined (Fig.~\ref{alg:sim:reg}), which
  simulates all protocol instances, but in response to \textsc{register}
  messages from $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}}$, it provides the public key of the
  key it just generated (as $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}}$ expects). It also
  keeps track of corruptions and informs $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}}$ thereof.
  Lastly, we argue that the functionality and simulator that were used in
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:dummy} can be replaced by their newly defined counterparts
  without introducing any discernible difference to the transcript that any
  \environment{} sees. This is achieved by exhaustive enumeration of all
  possible messages and comparison of the behaviour of the ideal and the real
  world for each, to conclude that the change is transparent to \environment.

  For the formal proof, we refer the reader to Appendix~\ref{appendix:secproof}.
