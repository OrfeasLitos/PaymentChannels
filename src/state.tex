\section{State of a channel}
  Consider a channel between \alice{} and \bob. Both parties hold some data
  locally that correspond to ownership of some funds in the channel. Here we
  define a concise way of representing this data.

  What \alice{} really holds, specific for this channel:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item local \{payment, htlc, delayed\_payment\}\_basepoint\_secret
    \item remote \{payment, htlc, delayed\_payment\}\_basepoint
    \item local per\_commitment\_secret[1,...,n+2]
    \item remote per\_commitment\_point[1,...,n]
    \item more stuff
  \end{itemize}
