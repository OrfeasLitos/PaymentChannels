\section{State of a channel}
  Consider a channel between \alice{} and \bob. Each party holds some data
  locally that are enough to ensure ownership of some funds in the channel. This
  is the data \alice{} holds:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item keys:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item local funding secret key ($s_{\alice, F}$)
      \item remote funding public key ($p_{\bob, F}$)
      \item local payment ($sb_{\alice, \mathrm{pay}}$), htlc ($sb_{\alice,
      \mathrm{htlc}}$), delayed payment ($sb_{\alice, \mathrm{dpay}}$),
      revocation ($sb_{\alice, \mathrm{rev}}$) basepoint secrets
      \item remote payment ($pb_{\bob, \mathrm{pay}}$), htlc ($pb_{\bob,
      \mathrm{htlc}}$), delayed payment ($pb_{\bob, \mathrm{dpay}}$), revocation
      ($pb_{\bob, \mathrm{rev}}$) basepoints
      \item seed (for deriving local per commitment keypairs ($s_{\alice,
      \mathrm{com}, n}, p_{\alice, \mathrm{com}, n}$))
      \item one remote per commitment secret ($\forall i \in [1, \dots, n],
      s_{\bob, \mathrm{com}, i}$) for each \textsc{commitmentSigned} received
      \item the current and the next remote per commitment points ($p_{\bob,
      \mathrm{com}, n}$ and $p_{\bob, \mathrm{com}, n + 1}$)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \alice's coins (integer)
    \item \bob's coins (integer)
    \item every HTLC that is included in the latest irrevocably committed (local
    or remote) commitment:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item direction ($\alice \rightarrow \bob$ or $\bob \rightarrow \alice$)
        \item hash
        \item preimage (or $\bot$ if still unresolved)
        \item coins (integer)
        \item Is it included in latest $\mathtt{localCom}_n$? (boolean)
        \item HTLC number
      \end{itemize}
    \item signatures:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\forall i \in [1, \dots, n],$ signature of $\mathtt{localCom}_i$
      generated with $s_{\bob, F}$
      \item for every HTLC included in $\mathtt{localCom}_i$, if HTLC is
      outgoing, a signature for \texttt{HTLC-timeout}, else a signature for
      \texttt{HTLC-success} with $s_{\bob, \mathrm{htlc}, i}$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  Every other piece of data used in the protocol can be derived by the above.
