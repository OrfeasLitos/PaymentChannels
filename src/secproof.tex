    \begin{simulatorbox}{$\simulator{}_{\mathrm{LN}}$}
      Expects the same messages as the protocol, but messages that the protocol
      expects to receive from \environment, the simulator expects to receive
      from $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}}$ with the name of the player appended.
      The simulator internally executes one copy of the protocol per player.
      Upon receiving any message, the simulator runs the relevant code of the
      protocol copy tied to the appended player name. Mimicking the real-world
      case, if a protocol copy sends a message to another player, that message
      is passed to \adversary{} as if sent by the player and if \adversary{}
      allows the message to reach the receiver, then the simulator reacts by
      acting upon the message with the protocol copy corresponding to the
      recipient player. A message sent by a protocol copy to \environment{} will
      be routed by \simulator{} to $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}}$ instead. To
      distinguish which player it comes from, \simulator{} also appends the
      player name to the message.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:dummy}
    $\textsc{Exec}^{\ledger}_{\Pi_{\mathrm{LN}}, \adversary_{\mathrm{d}},
    \environment} = \textsc{Exec}^{\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}},
    \ledger}_{\simulator_{\mathrm{LN}}, \environment}$
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    Consider a message that \environment{} sends. In the real world, the
    protocol ITIs produce an output. In the ideal world, the message is given to
    $\simulator{}_{\mathrm{LN}}$ through $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}}$. The
    former simulates the protocol ITIs of the real world (along with their coin
    flips) and so produces an output from the exact same distribution, which is
    given to \environment{} through $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}}$. Thus the
    two outputs are indistinguishable.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:reg}
    $\textsc{Exec}^{\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, dummy}},
    \ledger}_{\simulator_{\mathrm{LN}}, \environment} =
    \textsc{Exec}^{\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}},
    \ledger}_{\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg}}, \environment}$
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    When \environment{} sends (\textsc{register}, delay, relayDelay) to
    \alice{}, it receives as a response (\textsc{register}, \alice, delay,
    relayDelay, $pk_{\alice}$) where $pk_{\alice}$ is a public key generated by
    \texttt{KeyGen}() both in the real (c.f. Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:support},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:support:keygen}) and in the ideal world (c.f.
    Fig.~\ref{alg:sim:reg}, line~\ref{alg:sim:reg:keygen}).

    Furthermore, one (\textsc{read}) is sent to \ledger{} from \alice{} in both
    cases (Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:support},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:support:lastpoll} and Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:support},
    line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:support:lastpoll}).

    Additionally, $\simulator{}_{\mathrm{LN - Reg}}$ ensures that the state of
    \alice{} ITI is exactly the same as what would have been in the case of
    $\simulator{}_{\mathrm{LN}}$, as
    lines~\ref{alg:protocol:support:delay}-\ref{alg:protocol:support:keygen} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:support} change the state of \alice{} ITI in the same
    way as lines~\ref{alg:sim:reg:delay}-\ref{alg:sim:reg:keygen} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:sim:reg}.

    Lastly, the fact that the state of the \alice{} ITIs are changed in the same
    way in both worlds, along with the same argument as in the proof of
    Lemma~\ref{lemma:dummy} ensures that the rest of the messages are responded
    in an indistinguishable way in both worlds.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:open}
    $\textsc{Exec}^{\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Reg}},
    \ledger}_{\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg}}, \environment} =
    \textsc{Exec}^{\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Open}},
    \ledger}_{\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}, \environment}$
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    When \environment{} sends (\textsc{openChannel}, \alice, \bob, $x$,
    \textit{fchid}, \textit{tid}) to \alice, the interaction of
    Figures~\ref{alg:protocol:open:env}-\ref{alg:protocol:open:fundingSigned}
    will be executed in both the real and the ideal world. In more detail, in
    the ideal world the execution of the honest parties will be simulated by the
    respective ITIs run by $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}$, so their
    state will be identical to that of the parties in the real execution.
    Furthermore, since $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}$ executes
    faithfully the protocol code, it generates the same messages as would be
    generated by the parties themselves in the real-world setting.

    We observe that the input validity check executed by $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{,
    Open}}$ (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open}, line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open:valid})
    filters only messages that would be ignored by the real protocol as well and
    would not change its state either (Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:open:env},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:open:env:valid}).

    We also observe that, upon receiving \textsc{openChannel} or
    \textsc{channelAnnounced}, $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Open}}$ does not send any
    messages to parties other than $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}$, so
    we don't have to simulate those.

    When \environment{} sends (\textsc{checkNew}, \alice, \bob, \textit{tid}) to
    \alice{} in the real world, line~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:valid} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew} will allow execution to continue if there
    exists an entry with temporary id \textit{tid} in \texttt{pendingOpen}
    marked as ``broadcast''. Such an entry can be added either in
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:open:env},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:open:env:pendingOpen} or in
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:open:openChannel},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:open:openChannel:pendingOpen}. The former event can
    happen only in case \alice{} received a valid \textsc{openChannel} message
    from \bob{} with temporary id \textit{tid}, which in turn can be triggered
    only by a valid \textsc{openChannel} message with the same temporary id from
    \environment{} to \bob{}, whereas the latter only in case \alice{} received
    a valid \textsc{openChannel} message from \environment{} with the same
    temporary id. Furthermore, in the first case the ``broadcast'' mark can be
    added only before \alice{} sends (\textsc{fundingSigned}, \textit{pchid},
    sig) to \bob{} (Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:open:fundingCreated},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:open:fundingCreated:mark}) (which needs a valid
    \alice-\bob{} interaction up to that point \TODO{more in-depth?}), and in
    the second case the ``broadcast'' mark can be added only before \alice{}
    sends (\textsc{submit}, (sig, $F$)) to \ledger{}
    (Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:open:fundingSigned},
    line~\ref{alg:protocol:open:fundingSigned:mark}) (which also needs a valid
    \alice-\bob{} interaction up to that point \TODO{more in-depth?})

    When \environment{} sends (\textsc{checkNew}, \alice, \bob, \textit{tid}) to
    \alice{} in the ideal world, line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:valid} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open} will allow execution to continue if there exists
    an entry with temporary id \textit{tid} and member \alice{} marked as
    ``\alice{} announced'' in \texttt{pendingOpen}(\textit{fchid}) for some
    \textit{fchid}. This can only happen if line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:announced:add}
    of Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open} is executed, where
    \texttt{pendingOpen}(\textit{fchid}) contains \textit{tid} as temporary id.
    This line in turn can only be executed if $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Open}}$
    received $\left(\textsc{channelAnnounced}, \alice, p_{\alice, F}, p_{\bob,
    F}, \mathit{fchid}, \mathit{pchid}, \mathit{tid}\right)$ from
    $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}$ such that
    \texttt{pendingOpen}(\textit{fchid}) exists and has temporary id
    \textit{tid}, as mandated by line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:announced:valid} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open}. Such a message is sent by
    $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg - Open}}$ of Fig.~\ref{alg:sim:open} either in
    lines~\ref{alg:sim:open:announced:alice:bothhonest}/\ref{alg:sim:open:announced:alice:alicehonest},
    or in
    lines~\ref{alg:sim:open:announced:bob:bothhonest}/\ref{alg:sim:open:announced:bob:bobhonest}.
    One of the first pair of lines is executed only if $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN -
    Reg - Open}}$ receives (\textsc{openChannel}, \alice, \bob, $x$,
    \textit{fchid}, \textit{tid}) from $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Open}}$ and the
    simulated \adversary{} allows a valid \alice-\bob{} interaction up to the
    point where \alice{} sends (\textsc{submit}) to \ledger, whereas one of the
    second pair of lines is executed only if $\simulator_{\mathrm{LN - Reg -
    Open}}$ receives (\textsc{openChannel}, \bob, \alice, $x$, \textit{fchid},
    \textit{tid}) from $\fpaynet{}_{\mathrm{, Open}}$ and the simulated
    \adversary{} allows a valid \alice-\bob{} interaction up to the point where
    \alice{} sends (\textsc{fundingSigned}) to \bob.

    The last two points lead us to deduce that
    line~\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:valid} of Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open} in the
    ideal and line~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:valid} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew} in the real world will allow execution to
    continue in the exact same cases with respect to the messages that
    \environment{} and \adversary{} send. Given that execution continues,
    \alice{} subsequently sends (\textsc{read}) to \ledger{} and performs
    identical checks in both the ideal (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:open},
    lines~\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:read}-\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:included})
    and the real world (Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew},
    lines~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:read}-\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:included}).

    Moving on, in the real world
    lines~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:prand}-\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:send} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew} are executed by \alice{} and, given that
    \adversary{} allows it, the code of Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:fundingLocked} is
    executed by \bob. Likewise, in the ideal world, the functionality executes
    lines~\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:mark}-\ref{alg:fpaynet:checkNew:sim} and as
    a result it (always) sends (\textsc{channelOpened}, \alice, \textit{fchid})
    to \simulator. In turn \simulator{} simulates
    lines~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:prand}-\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew:send} of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:checkNew} with \alice's ITI and, if \adversary{}
    allows it, \simulator{} simulates the code of
    Fig.~\ref{alg:protocol:fundingLocked} with \bob's ITI. Once more we conclude
    that both worlds appear to behave identically to both \environment{} and
    \adversary{} under the same inputs from them.
  \end{proof}
