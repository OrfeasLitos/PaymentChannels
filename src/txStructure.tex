A well-formed transaction contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A list of inputs
  \item A list of outputs
\end{itemize}
All inputs must be connected to valid, unconnected (unspent) outputs in the
state.

A well-formed input contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A reference to the output it spends
  \item The features of the input, along with relevant data
\end{itemize}

A well-formed output contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A value in coins
  \item The features of the output, along with relevant data
\end{itemize}

Available features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multiple signatures. Needed data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Output
    \begin{itemize}
      \item List of eligible public keys (if empty, anyone can spend)
      \item Number of signatures needed to spend (at most equal to the size of the
      list)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Input
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As many signatures as needed by the referenced output, created by
      private keys that correspond to the public keys specified in the
      referenced output
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Absolute locktime. Needed data for output:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item blocks, time or bottom
    \item If not bottom, the minimum block number/time after which output can be
    spent. If bottom, output can be spent immediately after being added to the
    state.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Relative locktime. Needed data for output:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item blocks, time or bottom
    \item If not bottom, the minimum block number/time that has to be included
    in the state before the output can be spent. If bottom, output can be spent
    immediately after being added to the state.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Hashlock. Needed data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Output: hash or bottom
    \item Input: If corresponding feature in the referenced output is a hash,
    the input must include a preimage to that hash, otherwise nothing.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An output may specify more than one valid spending method. Each method must
specify exactly which features are used and the relevant data. An input can use
any of the specified methods to spend the output.

Lastly, the sum of coins of the outputs referenced by the inputs of the
transaction (to-be-spent outputs) should be greater than or equal to the sum of
coins of the outputs of the transaction.
