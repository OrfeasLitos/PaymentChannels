A well-formed transaction contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A list of inputs
  \item A list of outputs
  \item An arbitrary payload (optional)
\end{itemize}
Each input must be connected to a single valid, previously unconnected (unspent)
output in the state.

A well-formed output contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A value in coins
  \item A list of spending methods. An input that spends this output must
  specify exactly one of the available spending methods.
\end{itemize}

A well-formed spending method contains any combination of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Public keys in disjunctive normal form. An input that spends using this
  spending method must contain signatures made with the private keys that
  correspond to the public keys of one of the conjunctions. If empty, no
  signatures are needed.
  \item Absolute locktime in block height, transaction height or time. The
  output can be spent by an input to a transaction that is added to the state
  after the specified block height, transaction height or time. If empty, output
  can be spent immediately after being added to the state.
  \item Relative locktime in block height, transaction height or time. The
  output can be spent by an input that is added to the state after the current
  output has been part of the state for the specified number of blocks,
  transactions or time. If empty, output can be spent immediately after being
  added to the state.
  \item Hashlock value. The output can be spent by an input that contains a
  preimage that hashes to the hashlock value. If empty, the input does not need
  to specify a preimage.
\end{itemize}

A well-formed input contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A reference to the output and the spending method it spends
  \item A set of signatures that correspond to one of the conjunctions of public
  keys in the referred spending method (if needed)
  \item A preimage that hashes to the hashlock value of the referred spending
  method (if needed)
\end{itemize}

Lastly, the sum of coins of the outputs referenced by the inputs of the
transaction (to-be-spent outputs) should be greater than or equal to the sum of
coins of the outputs of the transaction.
