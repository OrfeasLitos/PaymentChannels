\section{UC conventions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item send (\textsc{read}) to \ledger{} and assign reply to $\Sigma$ ... \\
    = \\
    \{ \\
    send (\textsc{read}) to \ledger{} \\ \ \\
    upon receiving delayed output $\Sigma$ ... \\
    \}
    \item every output that is returned by \fpaynet{} or a player to
    \environment{} is in fact a delayed output: It is handed over to
    \adversary{}, who in turn decides when to give it to \environment{}.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Differences from LND}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item They use an ad-hoc construction for generating progressive secrets
    from seed and index, we use a PRF.
    \item (Related) To revoke, they send the previous secret (which is a secret
    key), we send the randomness generated by the PRF.
    \item To generate several public keys from one piece of info, they use the
    basepoint and the per commitment point and take advantage of EC homomorphic
    properties. We use an Identity Based Signature scheme.
    \item To generate the shared secret/public key, they use an ad-hoc scheme.
    We define a new primitive.
  \end{itemize}
