  \begin{remark}[Differences between LN and current work]

    In LN, a new construction for generating a new secret during each channel
    update is used. It reduces the amount of space needed to maintain a channel
    from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$ in the number of updates. As far as we know, its
    security has not been formally analyzed. In the current paper we use instead
    a PRF (and do not take advantage of this space optimisation).

    Furthermore
    \begin{itemize}
      \item To generate several public keys from one piece of info, they use the
      basepoint and the per commitment point and take advantage of EC homomorphic
      properties. We use an Identity Based Signature scheme.
      \item They also provide a way to cooperatively close a channel.
      \item In LND there are more messages that cover errors in transmission etc.
      There are also rules that govern message retransmission upon connection
      failure.
      \item We don't use the concept of ``dust transactions/outputs''.
      \item In our case, the \texttt{delay} of a player is set once, at her
      registration. In contrast to LN, it can't be changed later.
    \end{itemize}
