...both on the throughput (measured in transactions/sec) and the time that each
transaction takes to settle...

2. high level overview of the protocol. complex. security?

3. Our results.

b. Proof security.
c. Combined signatures.
The benefits of our approach.
What do we learn.
 * Large scale protocol. Modular approach.
 * Exact security parameterisation with a proof ...
 * Highlight the underlying cryptographic primitives that are relevant,
 PRFs  and combined signatures.
