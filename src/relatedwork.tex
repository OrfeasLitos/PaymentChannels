\section{Previous Payment Networks in UC}
\label{appendix:relwork}
  In \cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18}, \cite{perun} and
  \cite{Malavolta:2017:CPP:3133956.3134096} the specified ledger functionality
  settles every submitted transaction immediately and makes it visible to all
  players. To date, such a ledger has not been realized by any protocol.
  Furthermore, any realistic model of the network, even if it does not consider
  an adversary, should consider the fact that messages reach their destination
  with a delay. Therefore it is plausible to believe that such a ledger
  functionality is not realizable on top of realistic network models, even when
  corruptions are not allowed. We therefore conclude that such a ledger is ``too
  ideal''.

  In \cite{sprites} the ledger is not explicitly specified as a functionality,
  but it is only informally described. Several smart contracts are formally
  defined instead as UC ITMs, which are the entities with which protocols
  ultimately interact. The execution model of these contracts and their
  interaction with the blockchain is explained in an intuitive way, but a
  relevant formalization of the ledger is lacking.
