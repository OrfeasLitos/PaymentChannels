\section{Previous Payment Networks in UC}

  In \cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18}, \cite{perun} and
  \cite{Malavolta:2017:CPP:3133956.3134096} the specified ledger functionality
  settles every submitted transaction immediately and makes it visible to all
  players. To date, such a ledger has not been realized by any protocol. In
  Section~\ref{sec:perfect-ledger} we argue that there is good reason for
  that: even under strong network assumptions (namely, a synchronous multicast
  network and a global clock), a ledger functionality with instant finality is
  unrealisable. We therefore conclude that the ledger vatiations used in the
  aforementioned works are ``too ideal.'' In contrast, for the first time, we
  present a payment network functionality that interoperates with a global
  ledger functionality for which we know, in light of the results of
  \cite{BMTZ17}, that is realisable by the Bitcoin blockchain and hence also
  reflects the actual parameters that can be enforced by the implementation.

  In \cite{sprites} the ledger is not explicitly specified as a functionality,
  but it is only informally described. Several smart contracts are formally
  defined instead as UC ITMs, which are the entities with which protocols
  ultimately interact. The execution model of these contracts and their
  interaction with the blockchain is explained in an intuitive way, but a
  complete formalization of the ledger is missing.
