\section{Overview of ledger functionality with instant finality}
\TODO{decide if separate section needed}
  A simple model of a perfect ledger is presented in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectledger:func}. In this functionality, all submitted
  transactions are instantly added to the ledger and immediately available to be
  read by all players. Albeit an attractive abstraction, such a ledger is
  unrealisable even under strong network assumptions, as proven in
  Theorem~\ref{theorem:perfectledger}. \TODO{bring functionality and theorem
  here}
