\section{Notes on Lightning Specification}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The relevant part of the specification can be found at
  \url{https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md}.
  \item In the current LND implementation and BOLT specification, only the
  opener (sender) of a channel funds it initially. In the present work, we allow
  both sides to fund the channel.
\end{itemize}
