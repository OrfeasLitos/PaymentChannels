\section{Instant finality ledgers are unrealisable}
\label{sec:perfect-ledger}
  As already mentioned, previous attempts at formalising payment channels in
  UC~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18,Malavolta:2017:CPP:3133956.3134096,sprites,perun}
  assume a variant of a ledger functionality with instant finality. We here
  define a representative variant of this approach \perfectledger{} (defined
  below) where all submitted transactions are instantly added to the ledger and
  immediately available to be read by all players. Subsequently we argue that,
  albeit an attractive abstraction, such a functionality is unrealisable, even
  under strong network assumptions, i.e. a multicast synchronous network
  $\FnetworkEd^1$. Such a network ensures that messages sent by honest parties
  will be instantly delivered to all other parties; no delays can be introduced
  by the adversary. We refer the reader to \redden{the full
  version~\cite{full-version}} for the formal definition of $\FnetworkEd^1$. The
  adversary however may choose to send its own messages only to specific
  parties. This allows the adversary to spread conflicting information or
  withhold data from some parties. This adversarial ability precludes the
  possibility of such a ledger to be realised. The \redden{complete} proof can
  be found in \redden{the full version~\cite{full-version}}.

  \begin{theorem}[Perfect Ledger is Unrealisable]
    \label{theorem:perfectledger}
    For any ITM \perfectprot{} there exist ITMs \perfectenv,
    \perfectadv{} such that for any ITM \simulator
    \begin{equation*}
      \textsc{Exec}^{\FnetworkEd^1, \gFclock}_{\perfectprot,
      \perfectadv, \perfectenv} \not\approx
      \textsc{Exec}^{\perfectledger, \gFclock}_{\simulator,
      \perfectenv}
    \end{equation*}
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{proofsketch}
    We take advantage of \perfectadv's ability to selectively send
    messages to specific players. In particular, \perfectenv{} starts
    an execution with two players and generates a random message $m$. In half of
    the executions (randomly selected),  the adversary simulates a ``broken''
    \perfectprot{} execution where the effects of submitting $m$ are only shared
    with one of the two players, say \alice{} by \perfectadv{} (in the
    real world). The environment then sends (\textsc{read}) to the other player,
    say \bob. If \bob{} returns a ledger containing $m$, then
    \perfectenv{} concludes that it is the ideal world, otherwise it
    sends (\textsc{read}) to \alice. If she returns a ledger with $m$, then
    \perfectenv{} concludes it is in the real world, otherwise it
    concludes it is in the ideal world.

    The above is not sufficient since a protocol may choose to return an empty
    ledger; to counter this, in the other half of the executions,
    \perfectenv{} sends (\textsc{submit}, $m$) to \alice{} and then
    (\textsc{read}) to \bob. If, and only if, \bob{} knows $m$, then
    \perfectenv{} concludes this is the ideal world. This forces the
    \perfectprot{} protocol to achieve instant finality and will establish that
    a distinguishing advantage exists no matter how \perfectprot{} is
    implemented.
