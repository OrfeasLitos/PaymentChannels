\section{A Perfect Ledger is unrealisable}
\label{appendix:perfectledger}
  As already mentioned, previous attempts at formalising payment channels in
  UC~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18,perun,Malavolta:2017:CPP:3133956.3134096,sprites}
  assume a variant of a ledger functionality with instant finality. We here
  define a reasonable variant \perfectledger{} (Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectledger})
  and argue that such a functionality is unrealisable, even under strong network
  assumptions, i.e. a multicast synchronous network.

        \State State: List of txs $\mathcal{L}$
        \Statex

        \State Upon receiving (\textsc{Submit}, $m$) from \alice, append $m$ to
        $\mathcal{L}$ and send (\textsc{Submit}, \alice, $m$) to \adversary

        \State Upon receiving (\textsc{Submit}, $m$) from \adversary, append $m$
        to $\mathcal{L}$

        $\mathcal{L}$) to \alice

        \orfeas{next three entries are what I assume to be boilerplate for all
        UC functionalities -- correct me if I'm wrong}
        \State Upon receiving (\textsc{corrupt}, \alice) from \adversary, mark
        \alice{} as \texttt{corrupted} and route all future messages directed to
        \alice{} to \adversary
        \Statex

        \State Upon receiving any message (\textsc{handle}, \alice, $M$) from
        \adversary, if \alice{} is corrupted, handle message $M$ as incoming
        from \alice{} and if it creates an outgoing message $M'$ to
        \texttt{dest}, send ($M'$, \texttt{dest}) to \adversary{} instead
        \Statex

        \State Upon receiving any message (\textsc{forward}, \alice, $M$) from
        \adversary, if \alice{} is corrupted, send ($M$) to \alice

  \begin{theorem}[Perfect Ledger is Unrealisable]
    \label{theorem:perfectledger}
    For any ITM \perfectprot{} there exist ITMs \perfectenv,
    \perfectadv{} such that for any ITM \simulator
    \begin{equation*}
      \textsc{Exec}^{\FnetworkEd^1, \gFclock}_{\perfectprot, \adversary,
      \environment} \not\approx \textsc{Exec}^{\perfectledger,
      \gFclock}_{\simulator, \environment}
    \end{equation*}
  \end{theorem}

  We refer the reader to Appendix~\ref{appendix:ledger} for the definition of
  $\FnetworkEd^1$.

  \begin{proofsketch}
    We take advantage of the \adversary's ability to selectively send messages
    to specific players. The attack is as follows: \environment{} flips a coin.
    In one case, it \textsc{submit}s a random string through honest player
    \alice{} and \textsc{read}s through another player \bob,
    whereas in the other, it has \adversary{} \textsc{multicast} through
    $\FnetworkEd^1$ a random string only to \alice and then instructs either
    \alice{} or \bob{} (chosen again at random) to \textsc{read}. \environment{}
    returns 1 when the player that was asked coincides with the player that was
    initially informed \TODO{complete or delete}
  \end{proofsketch}

  \begin{proof}
    We first define the offending environment and adversary and subsequently
    show how they can distinguish the ideal from the real world.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{titlebox}{Environment \normalfont \perfectenv}{commonbox}{normal}
        Spawn two players, \alice{} and \bob. Flip a coin. If it returns 0,
        execute \texttt{writeWithPlayer}, otherwise execute
        \texttt{writeWithAdversary}.

              \State send (\textsc{read}) to \bob{} and assign result to

      \end{titlebox}
      \caption{}

    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{titlebox}{Adversary \normalfont \perfectadv}{commonbox}{normal}
        Upon receiving (\textsc{leak}, $m$) from \perfectenv, send
        (\textsc{multicast}, ($m$, \alice)) to $\FnetworkEd^1$
      \end{titlebox}
      \caption{}
      \label{fig:perfectledger:adv}
    \end{figure}

    Since we quantify over all possible \simulator{} and \perfectprot, we have
    to refer to the probabilities of them taking specific actions of interest:
    \begin{gather*}
      \pssubmits = \Pr[\text{Upon receiving (\textsc{leak}, $m$) from
      \environment,} \\
      \text{\simulator{} sends (\textsc{submit}, $m$) to $\mathcal{L}$}] \\
      \ppsubmits = \Pr[\text{Upon receiving (\textsc{submit}, $m$) from
      \environment,} \\
      \text{\perfectprot{} sends (\textsc{multicast}, $m$) to $\FnetworkEd^1$}]
      \\
      \ppfetches = \Pr[\text{Upon receiving (\textsc{read}) from \environment,}
      \\
      \text{\perfectprot{} sends (\textsc{fetch}) to $\FnetworkEd^1$} \\
      \text{and appends result to $\mathcal{L}$ before sending it back to
      \environment}]
    \end{gather*}

    We first analyze the event in which the initial coin flip of \environment{}
    results in 0, $\mathrm{Coin}_0$. In the ideal world, the submitted message
    $m$ always ends up in the ledger right away and therefore when
    \environment{} has \bob{} \textsc{read}, it always sees $m$ in the answer,
    therefore (Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectledger:env},
    line~\ref{fig:perfectledger:env:coin0:in})
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coin0:ideal}
      \Pr[\textsc{Exec}^{\perfectledger}_{\simulator, \perfectenv} = 1 |
      \mathrm{Coin}_0] = 1 \enspace.
    \end{equation}

    In the real world, in order for the submitted message $m$ to be in \bob's
    response to \textsc{read}, he must have fetched from $\FnetworkEd^1$ and
    \alice{} must have sent $m$ to $\FnetworkEd^1$ when she received
    (\textsc{submit}, $m$), therefore
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coin0:real}
      \Pr[\textsc{Exec}^{\FnetworkEd^1, \gFclock}_{\perfectprot, \perfectadv,
      \perfectenv} = 1 | \mathrm{Coin}_0] = \ppsubmits \ppfetches \enspace.
    \end{equation}

    We now move on to the event in which the initial coin flip results in 1,
    $\mathrm{Coin}_1$. In the ideal world, if \simulator{} submits the received
    $m$ to the ledger then both \environment's \textsc{read} requests will be
    answered with an output that contains $m$, therefore
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coin1:ideal}
      \Pr[\textsc{Exec}^{\perfectledger}_{\simulator, \perfectenv} = 1 |
      \mathrm{Coin}_1] = \pssubmits \ppfetches \ppfetches \enspace.
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}
