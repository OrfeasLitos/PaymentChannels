\section{General properties of Payment Channels}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Number of participants in the channel
    \item On-chain connection(s) between participants
    \item Actions: open, update, execute, close
    \item Who needs to sign for each action, who is notified, how many rounds of
    communication?
    \item What information can one obtain by observing the blockchain?
    \item Under what circumstances an operation cannot complete? (e.g. concurrency issues)
    \item Which participants are aware of the identity of which participants?
    \item Is there an upper bound to the amount of updates? How is this number decided?
    \item Can a participant unilaterally commit on-chain?
    \item Up to how much money can a participant unilaterally obtain?
    \item What can a malicious party do? If it corrupts more participants it can do more?
    \item Can a malicious/honest-but-curious party that is a participant learn who is
    transacting with who?
    \item How much slower is the process in case of a malicious party?
    \item How expensive are the actions? (CPU, memory, storage)
    \item How expensive are interactions with the blockchain? (fees, time, etc.)
  \end{enumerate}
